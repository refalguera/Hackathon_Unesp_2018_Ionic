# Hackathon_Unesp_2018

Project to create an application for urban mobility. It was classified in Third Place in the Hackathon of 2018. Realized in group by: Mariana Melo, Otávio Jóse Bertozzi, Renata Falguera and Rodney de Souza.

IDEIA: The application would serve to recharge the bus pass via cell phone and would also bring scolding about the stocking of a particular bus, thus allowing the user to check if it would be possible to catch him or not.

TOOLS: IONIC FRAMEWORK was used to carry out this project. The application did not get ready, due to the time of Hackathon was made a very simple version of the idea.
